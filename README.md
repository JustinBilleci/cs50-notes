 notes for Harvard cs50 course


-Algorithms are akin to teaching a child how to do something they've never done before.

-Crashes are due to buggy code on the creators part most of the time. 

-C is a primitive but incredibly fast language, which is why other languages use C in the background. 

-Computer Science isn't just programming it is the study of information.

-unary is a simple system that shows a single digit, binary is the system computers use, also called base-2. binary digit = "bit" a bit is a 0 or a 1. A bit is like lightbulb 0=light off,  1=light on this is representative of a transistor. 8 bits = 1 byte.

-A = 65 b = 66 and so forth. 01000001 = 65 as well.  

-ASCII = maps between numbers and letters. In ASCII the number 1 = 49. ASCII can represent 256 total characters, to solve this we add more bits, bytes, etc. 

-Unicode is an organization dedicated to capturing all forms of human language. Unicode also created the emoji

-There is many ways color can be shown on computers but RGB is the most common. 

-images are represented by a multitude of pixels of varying colors to compose an image. videos do the same but the pixels change colors over a period of time.

-videos are basically just a flipbook. a sequence of pictures which themselves are made of pixels.
